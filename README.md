# Business Analytics Web Form

## Project Description
This form is created for students of a Business Analytics program to capture their academic details and preferences in a user-friendly manner.

## Best Practices for Web Forms
The web form is carefully crafted, following best practices to provide a smooth experience. We've designed it to have a logical flow, asking for user information in a sequence that makes sense and reduces the chance of confusion or errors. This begins with simple identification questions and progresses to more specific academic details.

I made sure that each input field is accompanied by a clear, descriptive label. This not only helps users understand what information is required but also aids in form navigation. To reduce user errors, form fields are validated in real-time, providing users with immediate and helpful feedback on what they need to correct. This is especially useful for critical fields where specific data formats are required.

For a better user experience, especially on mobile devices, we've implemented responsive design principles. Input fields and buttons are large enough to be easily tapped on a touchscreen, and the layout adjusts to a variety of screen sizes and orientations, ensuring the form is usable on any device.

## Accessibility
Accessibility is a key aspect of web form design. I've ensured that all form elements are accessible using keyboard navigation, which is crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies. Clear focus states are defined for interactive elements, so users can visually track where they are on the form. 

The color contrast used for text and background elements meets the WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, I've used labels where necessary to provide screen reader users with the same level of information as sighted users.

By integrating these features, our web form is not only aligned with accessibility guidelines but also provides an inclusive experience for all students, regardless of how they interact with the web.
